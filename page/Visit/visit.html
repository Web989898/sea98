              This the best of Picture of battambang city <br><br>
              Battambang town is at the heart of Cambodia's 'rice bowl',
              and even though it is the country's second biggest town,
              it still has a very local, untouristed, provincial atmosphere. 
              Much of the architecture is French colonial and traditional Cambodian.
              Few buildings are over three stories, and the main streets are shared 
              by cars and horse carts alike. Unlike more touristed towns, the local 
              economy is truly local-based firmly in rice, wood, sapphires and food 
              crops - and is reflected in the character of the town. Similarly, as 
              you leave Battambang by road, the scene quickly becomes one of small 
              villages, rice paddies, and farmland, offering an excellent opportunity 
              for the visitor to see a bit of 'unspoiled' rural Cambodia.</p>
